## An overview of cocktail website idea, with a description of the key features:

This cocktail website boasts an array of impressive features. Users can search for a wide range of cocktails by their names. Even if the specific name isn't known, the site offers the option to search cocktails by their initial letter, providing a comprehensive list of cocktail names that match the search criteria.

Moreover, the website enables users to search for cocktail names using filters based on various attributes such as:

Type: Alcoholic or non-alcoholic
Category: Ordinary Drink or Cocktail
Glass: Cocktail glass or Champagne flute

Each search result presents users with the ability to select their favorite drink. Furthermore, the platform offers detailed instructions on how to prepare the selected cocktail, enhancing the user experience and encouraging experimentation with new drinks.

#### A technical hurdle:

Creating a website that works well on various devices and screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobiles) requires a deep understanding of responsive design techniques. Achieving a consistent user experience across devices can be complex. I need to learn some of these techniques and implement them in my futur projects.


    
##### Something that I learned and enjoyed:

Developing front-end applications using JavaScript is really intersting and Fun. I enjoyed while getting API requests from the database and organize them in a way you want for front-end websites and good looking layouts and designs were also really fun.


 
###### A new technology used:

CSS
HTML
JavaScript



###### Wishlist Future Features

In the future, I plan to incorporate additional features like a navigation menu comprising Home, About, Popular Cocktails, and Contact sections.

Furthermore, I aim to develop a login page where users can log in and store their favorite cocktails information within their accounts.

To facilitate this, I intend to create a personalized backend using Node.js along with a MongoDB database. This backend will offer Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities through custom API endpoints.
